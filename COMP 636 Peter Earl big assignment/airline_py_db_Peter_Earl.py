# My code is at the point where it can perform every single requirement in the assignment instructions, HOWEVER I have not had enough time
# to control user data input, show examples how the data input should be entered or display error messages for each section as this was something
# I had planned to do at the end of creating all the code functionality. As my code ended up being quite long I was not able to add in these controls 
# everywhere I would have liked, especially as the testing has become quite time consuming. So PLEASE just be careful with your data inputs
# as all of the functions SHOULD work, but the program in its current state is still fragile so often exact input is required. Please be patient and
# thankyou for taking the time to look over my code :D
